	<h2>ACT 1</h2>
	<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
	<p style="font-variant: small-caps;">
			Two households, both alike in dignity,<br/>
			In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br/>
			From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br/>
			Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br/>
			From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br/>
			A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br/>
			Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br/>
			Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br/>
			The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br/>
			And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br/>
			Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br/>
			Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br/>
			The which if you with patient ears attend,<br/>
			What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. <br/>

	<h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>

	<p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>

	<h3>SAMPSON</h3>

	<p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

	<h3>GREGORY</h3>

	<p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
